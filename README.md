# PracticalInterviewProblems
A fresh take on "whiteboard" problems.

Problems are contained in their own folder, and in the case of web problems,
should work out of the box by just running a simple serve command. In this
case, for ```commentadito``` you have to call livereload (or your server of
choice) on the root of that problem.
