# PracticalInterviewProblems
A fresh take on "whiteboard" problems.

Problems are contained in their own folder, and in the case of web problems,
should work out of the box by just running a simple serve command. In this
case, for ```commentadito``` you have to call
[livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload) (or your static file
server of choice) on the root of that problem's folder.
